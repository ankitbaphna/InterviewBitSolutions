/**
 * Using Bit Magic: The idea is based on the concept that if we AND a
 * bit sequence with a shifted version of itself, weâ€™re effectively
 * removing the trailing 1 from every sequence of consecutive 1s.
 * <p>
 * 11101111   (x)
 * & 11011110   (x << 1)
 * ----------
 * 11001110   (x & (x << 1))
 * ^    ^
 * |    |
 * trailing 1 removed
 * So the operation x = (x & (x << 1)) reduces length of every sequence
 * of 1s by one in binary representation of x. If we keep doing this operation
 * in a loop, we end up with x = 0. The number of iterations required to
 * reach 0 is actually length of the longest consecutive sequence of 1s.
